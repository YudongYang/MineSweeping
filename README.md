# MineSweeping

Mine Sweepingï¼Œthe classical Windows Little Game, coding by JavaScript

## Why I coding this?

Because someone tell me coding a MineSweeping is cool!

And I want test my coding ability about algorithm.

So I coding the MineSweeping logic with JS first time.

After that, I found many example that write by another. 

But, I found many of them is CTRL + C example.

They lway have the same UI, and they are always have the same BUG.

Yes, they are using JQuery the same.

## Why VUE?

After I finish the logic, I found that I always using a params printMap to show the MAP which is for user.

The VUE is PUSH and beginning so hot that time.

And VUE data bind is the best choise to display param printMap.

So I want to learning VUE too.

And the VUE code part may coding stupid. Wa hahahaha...

And I just learning VUE, so using JQuery And Bootstrap for UI...

But I have no time to recoding this part now.

## Why rank?

I want to write a Node.js server to record the rank.

But it's stop.
